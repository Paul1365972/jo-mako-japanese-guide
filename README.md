# Jo-Mako's Japanese Guide Recovery

A few years ago Jo-Mako's Japanese Guide was hosted on GitHub pages, but has since disappeared. Luckily there was a single web archive snapshot, so I could at least recover the grammar page.

You can check it out here:

I also updated it a bit to match current web standards.
If you are interested, all changes are listed below:

- Fix broken resources
- Lazy load images
- Do not preload audio
- Add frequency information
- ...
